# WIC_Portfolio_Performance

True performance of the Western Investment Club's portfolio in the 21/22 school year should be different than my notebook given as the timeset for both start & end are arbitrary (take FTNT for example). Please feel free to fork this repository and build your own script to assess your portfolio or WIC's actual performance last year.
